# About this project

This is an app that uses Rails in API mode, ActiveAdmin, and React on the frontend. It's based on this [post](https://blog.heroku.com/a-rock-solid-modern-web-stack).

I'm sure my React code in here could use some cleanup but I was just excited to give a project like this a try and banged it out exactly to the instructions. I think this model will likely provide a base for an upcoming project I've been thinking about that tracks goal progress using a variety of metrics depending on the type of project.

You can see the deployed app [here](https://sheltered-waters-26110.herokuapp.com/) (while I keep the dyno up).
